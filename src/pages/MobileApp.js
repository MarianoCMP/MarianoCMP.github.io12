<h1>Scamazon Project</h1>
        <h2>One of my favorite group projects was
            working with Android Mobile Programming with two friends.
            We just had fun with it (thus the name "Scamazon"), we used Amazon
            API and VPN's since Amazaon Rainforest thought we were hackers ðŸ˜‰. My contribution to the Project
            was the Preferences and Settings.
